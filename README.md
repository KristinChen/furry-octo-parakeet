# nlp-coe

Second week’s progress:
1.	Completed developing basic functionalities of tokenize() and root_words()
2.	Tested normal arguments and some edge arguments on these two functions.

To-dos:

For tokenize() : 
1)	Make the parameters’ expected format more user-friendly
2)	More edge cases/dirty data to be tested

For root_words():       
1)	Allow users to keep original format of selected words and punctuations.      
2)	More edge cases/dirty data to be tested
