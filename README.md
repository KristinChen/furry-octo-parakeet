First week progress:
1.	Completed developing basic functionalities of remove_punct() and clean_typos()
2.	Tested normal arguments and some edge arguments on these two functions.
To-dos:
For remove_punct() : 
1)	Not allowing user to input one back slash (‘\’) alone in parameter “include”. 
2)	More edge cases/dirty data to be tested
For clean_typos():       
1)	More nouns having specific meanings, such as brands (chewy), abbreviations (ASAP), jargons (call option), cyber lingos (lol), and locations (Maryland) are tested and currently failed.
2)	Better pre-trained models more suitable for specific fields to be studied.
3)	Allow users to input a dictionary indicating what words are corrected in wrong ways, and what are the proper corrections.
