Third weekâ€™s progress:

1.	Completed developing basic functionalities of remove_stopwords() and num_to_words()
2.	Tested normal arguments and some edge arguments on these two functions.

To-dos:

1.	Developing functions for detection purposes (detecting punctuations, stopwords etc. that are in the sentence). 
2.	More smaller functions that deal with specific scenarios (For instance, dealing with factors to convert them to words).
