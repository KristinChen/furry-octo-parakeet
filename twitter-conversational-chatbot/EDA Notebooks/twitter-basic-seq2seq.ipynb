    "- Shared word embeddings\n",
    "  - A shared embedding layer that turns word indexes (a sparse representation) into a dense/compressed representation.  This embeds both the request from the customer, and also the last words uttered by the model that are fed back into the model.\n",
    "- Encoder RNN\n",
    "  - In this case, a single LSTM layer.  This encodes the whole input sentence into a context vector (or thought vector) that represents completely what the customer is saying, and produces a single output.\n",
    "- Decoder RNN\n",
    "  - This RNN (also an LSTM in this case) decodes the context vector into a string of tokens/utterances.  For each time step, it takes the context vector and the embedded last utterance and produces the next utterance, which is fed back into the model.  More complex and effective models copy the encoder state into the decoder, add more layers of LSTMs, and apply attention mechanisms - but these are out of the scope of this simple example.\n",
    "- Next Word Dense+Softmax\n",
    "  - These two layers take the decoder output and turn it into the next word to be uttered.  The dense layer allows the decoder to not map directly to words uttered, and the softmax turns the dense layer output into a probability distribution, from which we pick the most likely next word.\n",
